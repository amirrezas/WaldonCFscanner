## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a top priority for tools designed to bypass censorship. 

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security vulnerability within WaldonCFscanner (e.g., DNS leaks, proxy routing flaws, or execution vulnerabilities), please report it privately by contacting the maintainer directly at: **walden.schmidttt@gmail.com**

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible, and we will strive to send you regular updates about our progress in addressing it. If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will issue a patch in a new release before disclosing the flaw publicly.
